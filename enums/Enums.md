###Enums
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.

Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".

Loop throw enums:
The enum type has a values() method, which returns an array of all enum constants.
