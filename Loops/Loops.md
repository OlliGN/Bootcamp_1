#### for-each Loop
for-each Loop ---> used to iterate through elements of arrays and collections (like ArrayList).
      for (dataType item : array){
             ... 
      }
Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, 
you declare a variable that is the same type as the base type of the array, 
followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
1.For-each loops are not appropriate when you want to modify the array.
2.For-each loops do not keep track of index. 
So we can not obtain array index using For-Each loop
3.For-each only iterates forward over the array in single steps
4.For-each cannot process two decision making statements at once
